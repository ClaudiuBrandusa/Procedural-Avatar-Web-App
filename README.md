## Description
This Web Application is the 'graphical interface' of it's API (https://github.com/ClaudiuBrandusa/Github-Like-Procedural-Avatar-API).  
As we can see, the interface is divided into two parts, left and right part.
On the right part we can change the input values and then click on ```Generate``` button when we are ready to generate an image.
On the left part we can see the image result of the generation.  
#### Below we can see some results:

#### We can also to influence the image's resolution.
##### The resolution's constraints are:

- max = 10000

#### After entering all the input data we can click `Generate` button and we will get an image result. The generation process happens in page, without needing to refresh the page.

#### For now we can't download the result image by clicking `Download image`, but at least we can download the image by right clicking on the image and downloading it using the browser's `save as` functionality.
