# Description
This Web Application is the 'graphical interface' of it's API (https://github.com/ClaudiuBrandusa/Github-Like-Procedural-Avatar-API).  
As we can see, the interface is divided into two parts, left and right part.
On the right part we can change the input values and then click on 'Generate' button when we are ready to generate an image.
On the left part we can see the image result of the generation.  
### Below we can see some results:

### The 'random color' check box stands for the result's color. By ticking we will get a random color for the image.

### We can also to influence the image's resolution.
#### The resolution's constraints are:  
- min = 100 
- max = 10000

### After entering all the input data we can click 'Generate' button and we will get an image result. The generation process happens in page, without needing to refresh the page.

### For now we can't download the result image by clicking 'Download image', but at least we can download the image by right clicking on the image and downloading it using the browser's 'save as' functionality.
